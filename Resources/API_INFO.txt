A typical METAR contains data for the temperature, dew point, wind direction and speed, precipitation, cloud cover and heights, visibility, and barometric pressure.

A METAR may also contain information onprecipitation amounts, lightning, and other information that would be of interest to pilots or meteorologists such as a pilot report or PIREP, colour states and runway visual range (RVR).

METAR Pieces
- temperature - T
- dew point - DP
- visibility - VIS
- precipitation (Wx - weather condition)
- wind direction - direction flag is pointing
- wind speed - feathers of flag
- cloud cover - Center icon pie chart
- cloud heights - CIG
- barometric pressure - ALTM?
- flight category/rules - center dot color etc
    - VFR
    - Marginal VFR
    - IFR
    - Low IFR


May have to get forcasted data and calculate flight rules manually. Maybe ask Prof about switching to displaying METARs or TAFs, not forecasted. But it is possible just tough.
